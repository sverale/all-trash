            <p class="info_second">When you enter into any new area of science, 
                you almost always find yourself with a baffling 
                new language of technical terms to learn before 
                you can converse with the experts. 
                <br><br>
                This is certainly true in astronomy both in terms 
                of terms that refer to the cosmos and terms that describe 
                the tools of the trade, the most prevalent being the telescope. 
                So to get us off of first base, let’s define some of the key 
                terms that pertain to telescopes to help you be able to talk 
                to them more intelligently.</p>

                Such software is rarely accompanied by uninstall utility 
                and even when it is it almost always leaves broken Windows 
                Registry keys behind it. Even if you have an anti-spyware 
                tool your Windows Registry might be broken – developers of 
                those tools are focused on removing Adware and spyware 
                functionality, not every trace</p>
